@README.md

Here are all standards of our codebase. These include architectural patterns and high-level coding standards but also very important and specific coding conventions such as when and how to write comments, naming conventions for files, classes, methods, variables, etc.

!`find docs/standards -type f | sed 's|^|@|'`

Follow the project standards strictly. Verify that all code adheres to the documented standards before considering a task complete.

For maximum efficiency, whenever you need to perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially.

Just reply "Ready!" then continue what you were doing.
