Welcome to my blog! I'm excited to finally have a space where I can share my thoughts on web development, coding adventures, and lessons learned along the way.

Learn <Highlight color="red">JavaScript</Highlight>, <Highlight color="blue">TypeScript</Highlight> and <Highlight color="green">Node.js</Highlight> through various articles and videos.

## Why Start a Blog?

I've been building things for the web for a while now, and I've always found that **writing helps me think**. Whether it's documenting a tricky bug I solved or exploring a new technology, putting thoughts into words solidifies my understanding.

  Writing helps solidify your understanding of complex topics. Try explaining something you just
  learned!

Plus, if something helped me, maybe it'll help you too.

## A Quick Code Snippet

Since this is a developer blog, let's kick things off with some code. Here's a simple function that greets the world in style:

```typescript
function greet(name: string): string {
  const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
  console.log(greeting);
  return greeting;
}

greet('World');
```

And here's how you might use this in a React component:

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';

export function Greeter() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('World');

  return (
    <div className="bg-card rounded-lg p-4">
      <input
        type="text"
        value={name}
        onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)}
        className="rounded border px-3 py-2"
        placeholder="Enter your name"
      />
      <p className="mt-4 text-xl font-bold">Hello, {name}!</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Visual Elements

Here's an example of including images with captions:

<Figure
  src={image}
  alt="Code on a computer screen"
  caption="Writing code is both an art and a science"
/>

And here's a Mermaid diagram showing a simple git flow:

<Mermaid
  chart={`
    gitGraph
      commit
      commit
      branch develop
      checkout develop
      commit
      commit
      checkout main
      merge develop
      commit
  `}
  caption="A typical git branching workflow"
/>

You can also create flowcharts:

<Mermaid
  chart={`
    flowchart LR
      A[Start] --> B{Is it working?}
      B -->|Yes| C[Great!]
      B -->|No| D[Debug]
      D --> B
  `}
  caption="The developer debugging loop"
  title="The developer debugging loop"
  className="mx-auto w-1/2"
/>

## What's Next?

I'll be writing about:

- **Modern web development** with tools like Astro, React, and TypeScript
- **Design systems** and building reusable components
- **Performance optimization** tips and tricks
- **Lessons learned** from real-world projects

Stay _tuned_, and feel _free_ to reach out if there's a `topic` you'd like me to cover.

See you in the next post!
