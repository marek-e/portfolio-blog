Open-source CLI built to scratch my own itch of setting up new projects repeatedly. Instead of copying configs between projects, DevKit generates them based on your preferences.

Features include interactive prompts with Ink for a modern terminal UI, plugin architecture for extensibility, and automatic detection of existing project configurations to avoid conflicts.
