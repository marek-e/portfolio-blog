Built this portfolio to showcase my work and share my thoughts on web development. The site uses Astro's island architecture for optimal performance, loading JavaScript only where interactivity is needed.

Key technical decisions included using OKLCH color space for perceptually uniform theming, implementing a zero-flash dark mode with localStorage persistence, and building a glassmorphic design system that works across both themes.
