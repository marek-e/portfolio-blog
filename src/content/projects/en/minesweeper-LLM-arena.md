AI Gateway Hackathon project — LLMs compete to solve Minesweeper on the same hidden board.

Each model is an autonomous agent that receives the visible board state and chooses cells to reveal. The backend simulates the game deterministically, and the UI replays all model runs side-by-side for comparison.

Deployed on Vercel, powered by AI Gateway + Vercel AI SDK.
