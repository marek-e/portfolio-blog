          I started coding when I was 16 after discovering you could build anything with just a
          computer and curiosity. What began as tinkering with simple websites turned into a career
          I genuinely love.
        </p>

        <p>
          These days, I focus on building web applications with modern tools like React, TypeScript,
          and Node.js. I care deeply about performance, accessibility, and creating interfaces that
          feel good to use.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you'll find me reading about software architecture, contributing to
          open source, or exploring new technologies. I believe in writing clean, maintainable code
          and learning something new every day.
