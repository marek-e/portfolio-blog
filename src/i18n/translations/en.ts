      'Everything started in High school during my Math classes. I was pretty good and always finished exercises early so I was spending time on my calculator. A TI-83CE. It is there a nex thing: programming language. At first I created a program that help me solve 2nd degree equations, then I started to create small 2D games. My first one was a Snake which was some dozens of line of code but then I was yearning for more challenge and was aiming for a Bataille Navale. I spent a lot of time on this and it was not an easy journey but here is the result. Thousand of line of codes for a basic interface but a working game and a new passion.',
      'In France to attend the best engineering school you have to attend preparatory classes to pass an exam. It was mainly scientific subjects but not much computer science. I did learn some stuff about Python, Mathlab and Arduino. It also confirmed my yearn for programming. But since it was a very demanding period in term of teaching, self-commitment, ... It learned me to manage my time, my stress and having an efficient way of learning a lot of stuff in a small time.',
      'In my engineering school I learned a lot of various concepts necessary to CS.',
      'These days, I focus on building web applications with modern tools like React, TypeScript, and Node.js. I care deeply about performance, accessibility, and creating interfaces that feel good to use.',
      'I like to share my learnings with others and, I firmly believe to open source, thus I would like to try contributing more to it.',
