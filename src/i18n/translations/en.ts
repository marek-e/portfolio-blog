      'Everything started in high school during my math classes. I was pretty good and always finished exercises early, so I spent time on my calculator. First, a program to solve second-degree equations, then a Snake game, and finally a full battleship game. Thousands of lines of code for a basic interface, but a working game, and above all a new passion ignited.',
      'In prépa (French prep school for engineering), I coded <a href="/en/projects/petanque" class="text-primary hover:underline">a petanque game in Python</a> to simulate Newton\'s laws. Later in engineering school, I discovered HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. That\'s when I realized you could build things that truly matter to users and all the complexities that come with it.',
      "Today, I'm at a point in my career where I've taken a deep breath to understand what really drives me. I love frontend and UX, I don't have the designer spark of building a perfect UI (mine looks like a 5-year-old choosing random colors), but all those UX tweaks: smooth animations, intuitive interfaces that don't make users overthink. Building user-friendly products that deliver actual value.",
      "I also love cybersecurity, I follow the news, I train and apply best practices to my code. It happens to me to participate in CTFs in my free time to practice and learn new techniques.",
      "I pay a lot of attention to DevX, as the advent of LLMs is changing our workflow as a developer. And I'm convinced that mastering AI tools is an essential skill for the future.",
